  <h2>Decription:</h2>

  <p>Minced clams with potatoes and onion simmered in a broth of clam juice and half-and-half. A great, hearty soup to start a meal off with, or can even be a meal in itself.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 slices of bacon</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup bottled clam juice</li>
    <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans minced clams</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream (Optional)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large saucepan over medium high heat, fry the bacon until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, reserving the bacon fat in the pan, crumble and set aside.</li>

    <li>In the same saucepan with the bacon fat, saute the onion and potatoes for 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the flour and stir well to coat.</li>

    <li>Pour in the clam juice, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.</li>

    <li>Add the half-and-half and minced clams and season with salt and pepper to taste. Finally, whisk in the heavy cream, if desired. Allow to heat through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with the parsley and crumbled bacon. (Note: Do not boil if adding cream.)</li>
  
  </ol>
